# FSDI FINAL PROJECT - Tech Storm

Tech Storm is an online store project made using the Django framework.

## Users

Users have one of two roles, Manager or Customer:

- Managers are able to access the Django admin page (but may not have the permissions to view the models), create other manager accounts, create/edit/delete products to sell.
- Customers are created through the regular sign up page, they're able to browse the store and add product to their cart, then being able to proceed to order those products.
